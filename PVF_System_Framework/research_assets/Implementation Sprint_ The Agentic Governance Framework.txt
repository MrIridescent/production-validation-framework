The research confirms that Zencoder and GitHub Copilot use different mechanisms for "governance," but they can be unified into a single workflow.
To solve this "once and always," you cannot rely on developers remembering to follow rules. You must productize the process by creating a set of "Actionable Tickets" that you can literally copy-paste into Jira, Linear, or GitHub Issues.
Here is your Implementation Sprint: The Agentic Governance Framework.
________________
Epic: Agentic Governance Rollout
Goal: Transition from "Vibe Coding" (chaotic, human-dependent) to "Agentic Engineering" (structured, automated, verified).
Definition of Done: A repository where AI agents automatically follow architectural rules, tests are mandatory before implementation, and bad code is physically blocked from commits.
________________
Ticket 1: Establish the "Constitution" (Single Source of Truth)
Priority: Critical / P0
Assignee: Tech Lead / Architect
Description:
AI agents (Zencoder & Copilot) currently lack shared context. We need a single "Constitution" that enforces our tech stack and security rules across both tools.
Implementation Steps:
1. Create a root directory: .governance/.
2. Create the master file: .governance/CONSTITUTION.md.
3. Content to Insert:
Engineering Constitution
   1. Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, TypeScript (Strict).
   2. Security: No hardcoded secrets. Zod validation for ALL inputs.
   3. Testing: Tests MUST be written before code (Red-Green-Refactor).
   4. Style: Functional components only. No any types.
   4. Sync to Zencoder:
   * Create .zencoder/rules/00-core.md.
   * Add Frontmatter to force it into context:
YAML
---
description: "Core Project Constitution - ALWAYS APPLY"
alwaysApply: true
---
(Import content from.governance/CONSTITUTION.md)

      5. Sync to Copilot:
      * Create .github/copilot-instructions.md.
      * Add: "You must strictly adhere to the engineering constitution below..." followed by the content.
Acceptance Criteria:
      * [ ] Asking Zencoder "What tech stack do we use?" returns the correct stack defined in .governance.
      * [ ] Asking Copilot "Generate a component" produces code that matches the strict style guide (e.g., no any types).

Ticket 2: Configure Zencoder "Flow" Agents
Priority: High / P1
Assignee: Senior Dev
Description:
Stop using the generic "Ask" agent for everything. We need specialized agents that force "Flow Engineering" (Plan -> Test -> Build).
Implementation Steps:
      1. Run Repo-Info: Run the Zencoder command /repo-info to generate the .zencoder/rules/repo.md context map.
      2. Create "The Architect" Agent:
      * Go to Zencoder > Custom Agents > Add.
      * Name: Architect
      * Prompt: "You are a System Architect. Your goal is to PLAN, not code. Read .zencoder/rules/00-core.md. When given a feature request, output a Markdown file specs/FEATURE_NAME.md detailing the files to create, data schemas, and edge cases. Do not generate implementation code."
      3. Create "The TDD Builder" Agent:
      * Name: TDD Builder
      * Prompt: "You are a Test-Driven Engineer. 1. Read the spec provided. 2. Create a FAILING test file first. 3. Wait for user confirmation. 4. Write the minimum code to pass the test. 5. Refactor."
Acceptance Criteria:
      * [ ] The Architect agent refuses to write code and instead writes a Plan/Spec file.
      * [ ] The TDD Builder agent creates a .test.ts file before creating the .ts implementation file.

Ticket 3: Automate the "Red-Green" Loop (VS Code Tasks)
Priority: Medium / P2
Assignee: Dev
Description:
Manually running tests and copying error messages to the AI is slow. We need a "One-Click" loop to feed errors back to Zencoder/Copilot.
Implementation Steps:
      1. Update .vscode/tasks.json with the "Test & Copy" task.
      2. Config Snippet:
JSON
{
 "label": "🔄 AI Loop: Test & Copy",
 "type": "shell",
 "command": "npm test -- --reporter=json > test-output.json |


| (cat test-output.json | pbcopy && echo '❌ Copied errors to clipboard!')",
"presentation": { "reveal": "always", "panel": "dedicated" }
}
```
(Note: Use clip.exe for Windows)
Acceptance Criteria:
         * [ ] Running the task runs the project tests.
         * [ ] If tests fail, the JSON error log is automatically in the user's clipboard, ready to paste into Zencoder.

Ticket 4: "Hard Governance" Gatekeeper (Husky)
Priority: Critical / P0
Assignee: DevOps / Lead
Description:
AI agents hallucinate and get lazy (e.g., leaving TODO or any). We must physically prevent this code from entering the repo.
Implementation Steps:
         1. Install Husky: npm install husky --save-dev && npx husky install.
         2. Create hook: .husky/pre-commit.
         3. Script:
Bash
#!/bin/sh

. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"






# 1. Block Lazy AI
if grep -r "TODO" src/ |

| grep -r "FIXME" src/; then
echo "🤖 Governance Protocol: Lazy AI detected (TODO/FIXME). Rejecting."
exit 1
fi






# 2. Block Hallucinated Types
if grep -r ": any" src/; then
 echo "🤖 Governance Protocol: Strict Type Violation ('any'). Rejecting."
 exit 1
fi

# 3. Verify Logic
npm test
```

Acceptance Criteria:
            * [ ] Try to commit a file with // TODO. The commit MUST fail.
            * [ ] Try to commit a file with something: any. The commit MUST fail.
            * [ ] Try to commit code that breaks tests. The commit MUST fail.

Ticket 5: "One Time" Project Setup Script (The Automation)
Priority: Low / P3 (Optional but recommended)
Assignee: DevOps
Description:
To ensure this works "Always" for every new project, create a scaffolding script.
Implementation Steps:
            1. Create a script init-agentic.sh.
            2. The script should:
            * Generate the .zencoder and .github folder structures.
            * Write the default CONSTITUTION.md files.
            * Install Husky and write the hooks.
            * Add recommended VS Code extensions (Zencoder, Copilot) to .vscode/extensions.json.
Acceptance Criteria:
            * [ ] Running npm run init-agentic in a blank folder sets up the entire governance framework automatically.

How to Execute This Plan
            1. Sprint 1 (Days 1-2): Complete Ticket 1 (Constitution) and Ticket 4 (Husky). This stops the bleeding immediately. No bad code gets in.
            2. Sprint 1 (Days 3-4): Complete Ticket 2 (Zencoder Agents). This changes the workflow from "chatting" to "engineering."
            3. Sprint 1 (Day 5): Complete Ticket 3 (VS Code Tasks). This speeds up the TDD loop.
This transforms your VS Code from a simple text editor into a Governed AI Factory. The "Constitution" creates the rules, the "Agents" follow the process, and "Husky" acts as the quality assurance guard.
